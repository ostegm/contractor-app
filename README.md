# Contractor Monorepo

This monorepo contains both the Next.js UI and LangGraph service for the Contractor project.

## Overview

The repo is structured to enable fast iteration while letting BAML autogenerate two clients:
- TypeScript/React client for the web app: `apps/web/baml_client/`
- Python/Pydantic client for the LangGraph service: `apps/langgraph/baml_client_py/`

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm run dev` - Start both Next.js UI and LangGraph servers
- `pnpm run dev:ui` - Start only the Next.js UI server
- `pnpm run dev:langgraph` - Start only the LangGraph server
- `pnpm run dev:baml` - Generate BAML clients in watch mode
- `pnpm run dev:all` - Start all services (BAML, UI, LangGraph)
- `pnpm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
- `pnpm run test` - Run JavaScript tests with Vitest
- `pnpm run test:python` - Run Python tests with pytest
- `pnpm run build` - Build all packages
