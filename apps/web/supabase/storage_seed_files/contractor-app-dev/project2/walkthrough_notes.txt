Plumbing staying in same location, but sink will be upgraded to large single-basin undermount model with disposal. Fridge to be moved slightly to allow for taller pantry cabinet. Electrical upgrades needed: new recessed lighting, pendant over island (which will be added — 4 ft x 2 ft, no plumbing, just base cabinets), and outlets added to meet code. Will also replace breaker if panel can’t support new load. No major structural work anticipated. Drywall patching and repaint throughout kitchen. Scope may expand to include painting adjacent dining area depending on final budget. Client emphasized desire for clean, modern look — “not luxury, but sharp and functional.” Target start mid-June, completion by mid-July.
