Walked the property with the client today to scope the main kitchen remodel. Existing kitchen is dated — likely original to the 1970s build — with worn laminate countertops, dark oak cabinets, and old appliances (freestanding electric range, top-freezer fridge, over-the-range microwave). Layout is staying mostly the same (U-shape with window over sink), but client wants to remove the upper cabinets on the window wall and replace with open shelving. Flooring throughout is linoleum, which will be removed and replaced with LVP or tile depending on budget. Client is unsure whether subfloor is level — we may need to correct if issues are found during demo. Wants all new cabinetry (likely shaker style, white or natural wood), soft-close hardware, quartz countertops, tile backsplash (subway or similar), undercabinet lighting, and modern pulls. Plumbing staying in same location, but sink will be upgraded to large single-basin undermount model with disposal. Fridge to be moved slightly to allow for taller pantry cabinet. Electrical upgrades needed: new recessed lighting, pendant over island (which will be added — 4 ft x 2 ft, no plumbing, just base cabinets), and outlets added to meet code. Will also replace breaker if panel can’t support new load. No major structural work anticipated. Drywall patching and repaint throughout kitchen. Scope may expand to include painting adjacent dining area depending on final budget. Client emphasized desire for clean, modern look — “not luxury, but sharp and functional.” Target start mid-June, completion by mid-July.
